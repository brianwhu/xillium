A DTP(Data Source, Transaction Manager, Persistence) triplet can be
    * In the root application context, shared by all modules
    * In a module application context, private to the module

While the modules form a forest of arbitrary depth by their interdependency relationship,
DTP triplets don't follow this structure. Any module not having a private DTP triplet
uses the DTP triplet defined in the root application context.
