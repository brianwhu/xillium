Service Deployment and Remote Management


HTTP and HTTPS
--------------

  HTTP and HTTPS applications can be deployed on a single Tomcat server. A convention is established to place HTTP service
  applications under $CATALINA_BASE/webapps, and HTTPS service applications under $CATALINA_BASE/secured.

  To indicate that an application should go under $CATALINA_BASE/secured, define a "deployment.target" property in the webapps'
  pom.xml file:

    <properties>
      <deployment.target>secured</deployment.target>
    </properties>

  On tomcat, server.xml should contain:

    <Service name="Catalina">
        <Connector port="80" .../>
        ...
        <Engine name="Catalina" ...>
            <Host ... appBase="webapps">
                ...
            </Host>
        </Engine>
    </Service>
    <Service name="Secured">
        <Connector port="443" .../>
        ...
        <Engine name="Secured" ...>
            <Host ... appBase="secured">
                ...
            </Host>
        </Engine>
    </Service>


New Application Servers
-----------------------

  Installing runtime tools from build management server:

    $ bin/inst @ENV

  Preparing Tomcat on target server:

    $ deployment/rt/bin/prep


Application Deployment
----------------------

    $ bin/deploy @ENV

  Redeploying active applications:

    $ bin/redeploy @ENV


Applications Control
--------------------

    $ bin/xctl stop @ENV

    $ bin/xctl start @ENV

    $ bin/restart @ENV
