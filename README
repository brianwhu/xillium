Xillium Service Platform

The Xillium Service Platform is put in place to allow fast and quality construction
of enterprise solutions that are secure, performant, capacious, agile, and robust,
by following a well-chosen set of time-honored approaches and technologies. It does
so by staying close and faithful to

   Service oriented architecture
   Plain HTTP service invocation + JSON responses
   A very thin Java-RDBMS interworking layer
   Most important design patterns and abstractions

Xillium is built upon open source frameworks, most notably the Spring Core framework,
and leverages the best of the modern Java technologies. It is a platform still in
fast evolution but its merits already proven to be viable in creating solutions as
large as a real-time mass-assess trading system and as small as an online calculator.
